🎯**Purpose**🎯 Showcase project from the third semester at Toronto Film School's video game development program.

📚**What I Learned**📚
- **Level Design Principles and Techniques**: I developed a solid understanding of how to craft engaging and challenging levels, focusing on player experience and progression.
- **Procedural Level Generation**: I gained hands-on experience in creating algorithms that dynamically generate levels, ensuring each playthrough offers a unique experience.
- **Animation Editing**: I learned to work with existing animation assets, refining them to fit the game’s style and requirements. This included adjusting timing, blending animations, and ensuring smooth transitions between different character states.

🛠️**What I Implemented**🛠️
- **Complete Game Loop Integration**: I successfully integrated all components of the game loop, from initializing the game to handling player inputs, managing game states, and finalizing the gameplay experience with ending condition.
- **Game Logic Development**: I built and refined the core logic that drives the game's mechanics, ensuring that player actions result in expected and enjoyable outcomes. This included collision detection, score calculation, and difficulty scaling.
- **Audio Cue Incorporation**: I integrated audio cues throughout the game, enhancing the player’s immersion and feedback. This involved selecting and timing sound effects to correspond with in-game events, such as explosion, hits, and level completions.
